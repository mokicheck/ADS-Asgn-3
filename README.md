README

This repository contains two classes that implement the ListQueue and LinkedListStack data structures. 

The ListQueue class uses an ArrayList to implement a queue, which is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It has the following methods:

- `enqueue(data)`: adds an element to the back of the queue.
- `isEmpty()`: checks if the queue is empty and returns a boolean value.
- `dequeue()`: removes and returns the front element of the queue.
- `peek()`: returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
- `getSize()`: returns the number of elements in the queue.

The LinkedListStack class uses a LinkedList to implement a stack, which is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It has the following methods:

- `pushMethod(data)`: adds an element to the top of the stack.
- `isEmpty()`: checks if the stack is empty and returns a boolean value.
- `popMethod()`: removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- `peekMethod()`: returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- `getSize()`: returns the number of elements in the stack.
